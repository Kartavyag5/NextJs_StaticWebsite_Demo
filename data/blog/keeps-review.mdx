If you’re one of the many men suffering from hair loss, you’ll be glad to know that there are some scientifically backed, FDA-approved treatments available.
These treatments do not offer magical fixes, but if your hair loss is due to male pattern baldness, they can effectively stop hair loss, preserve the hair you still have, and even regrow hair you thought was gone for good.

<Header text="How Keeps works" />

The effectiveness of your Keeps experience will have a lot to do with your specific treatment regimen and hair loss goals. A man who’s been completely bald for years will not see a big improvement by just using a thickening shampoo. But even men significantly far along in their hair loss have options from Keeps that can be quite effective.

Plenty of studies point to the efficacy of both finasteride and minoxidil, the two primary offerings you’ll find on the Keeps website. They’ve both stopped hair loss and grown new hair in these clinical trials, albeit slowly and with consistent use. You could see significant improvements with time if you couple either or both of those treatments with a medicated shampoo and a nourishing conditioner.

<Header text="What types of products does Keeps offer?" />

With finasteride and minoxidil as their primary treatment options, Keeps delivers the two best-known answers for men fighting hair loss. And they offer the latter in both solution and foam form, so you can determine which application method suits you best. They take the doctor-patient relationship seriously, as well, and regard hair loss from the proper medical perspective. That’s why they give you a whole year of messaging with your doctor for free.

When it comes to ancillary treatments, the Keeps Ketoconazole 2% shampoo is an excellent addition. It’s not technically designed to fight hair loss, but its anti-dandruff capabilities can cleanse and care for the scalp, which helps inhibit hair loss and promote new growth. Supporting this with the company’s thickening shampoo and conditioner helps complete your regimen.

<Header text="What makes an ideal candidate for Keeps?" />

<FrequentlyAskedQuestion title="Why should I care about gut health?">

**Numerous studies link the strains of bacteria** and other microbes living in your gut to your
overall health. They play an essential role in digestion, but they can also influence our
immunity, skin health, energy levels, and mental health. Taking good care of your microbiome can
help you with anything from losing stubborn weight to overcoming mild depression or anxiety.

</FrequentlyAskedQuestion>

<FrequentlyAskedQuestion title="Is stool sample collection messy?">

While the idea of collecting your stool sample might have you second-guessing whether you want to
take a microbiome test, rest assured that Ombre makes the process pretty easy. Many other
companies will have you set up a device to catch the stool and take a sample from it before it
hits the water. Ombre keeps things simpler, allowing you to collect your sample from your toilet
paper as you clean up after yourself. So, it ends up being no messier than wiping.

</FrequentlyAskedQuestion>

<FrequentlyAskedQuestion title="How long do I have to wait for gut health test results?">

Once a lab receives your sample, results typically take about three weeks to arrive. Be sure to
create a profile on the Ombre website so you can check your results portal regularly. Some of our
testers found that results could come in with no notification from the company. It may be up to
you to learn that your results have come in.

</FrequentlyAskedQuestion>

<FrequentlyAskedQuestion title="Which probiotics are right for me?">

The best way to find out which of Ombre’s probiotics are right for you is to take their Gut Health Test. However, if you want to try their products, you can choose based on your desired results. Ombre’s probiotics have names that make it easy to figure out which one you might want.²⁴

- Gut Health - ideal for anyone with digestive issues
- Metabolic Booster- good for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight
- Endless Energy - can help improve energy levels and sleep

1. Gut Health - ideal for anyone with digestive issues
2. Metabolic Booster- good for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight
3. Endless Energy - can help improve energy levels and sleep

Ombre also sells a prebiotic called Rise, and it’s suitable for use alongside any of their probiotics.

</FrequentlyAskedQuestion>

<FrequentlyAskedQuestion title="What happened to Thryve?">

Ombre would not disclose to us the reason for their rebranding. It may have been due — at least in
part — to the existence of a large cloud-based solutions company with the same name. However, it’s
telling that the company shook up their executive ranks when they underwent their rebranding.
Whatever the case, the company states that the new name “better reflects the company we are
building - one that reflects the science of the quantified self.”

Keeps provides you with a free initial consultation to determine which products may be best for your hair loss goals. The doctor also follows up a few weeks later to ensure you’re having an alright time using the product and not experiencing any side effects. For the next year, you get unlimited messaging with your doctor for free, and if you want to have another consultation for any reason, it costs just $5. And shipping on each order costs just $3.

**Insider Tip:** Sample collection can be challenging if your bowel movement is too dry. We recommend hydrating thoroughly for at least 24 hours leading up to your intended collection time. That will allow the provided swab to pick up more material in one swipe.

<Header text="How to get started with Keeps" />

Keeps has some of the most competitive prices in the business. Their products come in three-month supplies that renew and ship automatically, so you don’t have to worry about running out of anything you use. The price you see on the page is lower than those of competitive products, but it’s also worth noting that the prices of their products by volume are also lower. One ounce of their shampoo, for example, is cheaper than one ounce from another company. Innerbody Research readers also get 50% off their first order with our promo code.
